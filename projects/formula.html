                <h1>Olin Electric Motorsports</h1>

                <p class="project-subtitle">Olin Electric Motorsport is a student-run FSAE team based in Needham, MA. As the Accumulator Subteam Lead, I managed and mentored a team of 10 engineers, ensuring HV safety, and oversee the project timeline.
                
                Additionally, I am designing and fabricating the 400V battery and working closely with our Electrical subteam for subsystem integration.</p>

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Olin Electric Motorsports (OEM) is a student-run Formula SAE team that designs, builds, and races an all-electric, formula-style race car from scratch every year. As a member of the team, I have contributed to the mechanical and electrical integration of our vehicle's most critical system: the accumulator (battery pack).</p>

                    <h2>Accumulator Lead</h2>
                    <p>In my role as Accumulator Lead, I am responsible for the design, fabrication, and testing of the 600V battery pack. This involves managing a sub-team of engineers to ensure the system meets rigorous safety standards set by FSAE, while optimizing for weight and thermal performance.</p>
                    <p>Key responsibilities include overseeing the mechanical design of the container, cell module configuration, and ensuring seamless integration with the Battery Management System (BMS).</p>

                    <p>The design process began with extensive CAD modeling in SolidWorks to determine the most efficient layout for the lithium-ion cells. I performed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on the container structure to ensure it could withstand the required G-loads during competition.</p>
                    <p>Fabrication involved high-precision assembly of busbars and maintenance-plugs, alongside careful wiring of the high-voltage tractive system. Every step required strict adherence to safety protocols to prevent arcing and thermal runaway.</p>
