                    <p>
                        Olin Electric Motorsport is a student-run FSAE team based in Needham, MA. As the Accumulator Subteam Lead, I managed and mentored a team of 10 engineers, ensuring HV safety, and oversaw the project timeline.

                    <p>
                        Additionally, I designed and fabricated the 428V battery, working closely with our Electrical subteam for subsystem integration.

                            The 420V battery powers our electric vehicle.

                            I specked out the Molicel P45B Cell and a pack configuration that will allow us to finish the 22km Endurance Race while optimizing for weight and motor controller voltage constraints. The final configuration incorporated insights from performance data from previous events to meet the capacity requirements with a factor of safety. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The final configuration of 6x 102s 4p has a max voltage of 428 V, nominal energy of 6.6 kWh, and weight of 28.5 kg.

                        <p>
                            Each segment's structure consists of a polycarbonate frame to secure the cells, a power and thermistor board for temperature measurement and cell fusion, handles for quick removal, locating pins to restrict movement, and a touch cover for safety. This final architecture maintains a modular design to minimize risks during integration. Significant time was dedicated to refining the design, as well as the manufacturing and assembly processes, ensuring a well-thought-out approach.

                        <h2>02 / Segment Manufacturing</h2>
                        <p>
                            Before manufacturing the entire battery pack, a test segment of two parallel cell groups was made to test the mechanical assembly and tolerances of the design. This process allowed us to finalize the press fit tolerances and check the interfacing PCB with the fusible links and cells.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To make the manufacturing process quicker and more consistent, I programed the 3-axis CNC Mill to mill out the parts to the same tolerances. I also designed a manufacturing jig to easily align each sheet of polycarb on the mill.

                            Before hitting the track, the accumulator undergoes rigorous testing, including isolation monitoring checks and full-load discharge cycles to validate thermal models.
